            <h3>What is Campus Live Dashboard?</h3>
            <p>
                Campus Live Dashboard is a real-time platform that allows students to track the availability 
                of shared resources across the college campus. Our goal is to help students save time and 
                make informed decisions about where to go on campus.

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>
                Students can view the current status of various campus resources and contribute by updating 
                information based on their observations. The platform uses a voting system to ensure accuracy 
                and reliability of the information.
